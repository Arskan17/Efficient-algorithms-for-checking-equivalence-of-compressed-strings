1. For the pair (A,B), are A and B supposed to be from the same grammar?
    b/c if that's the case, wouldn't the length check (|w_A| = |w_B|) almost always return false atleast once? wouldn't that be pointless ?

2. Again, related to #1, wouldn't doing the split(A, rel) also be pointless, given that A is from the grammar?

3. What exactly is  rel:=U(A,B) in S (A, B, 0) ?
    is 0 any arbitrary number or does it depends on something?

4. Does the loop checks for every Ai in (A1,..., An) against every tripple in rel ?
    is this a nested loop situation or am I looking at it wrong ?

5. The proof of Theorem 12.

6. Since the grammar must be in CNF and can contain useless nonterminals, should those be included in the pairs?
    if so, wouldn't pairs with useless nonterminal just be simply a nonterminal?
    how does that help ?
